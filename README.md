<details><summary>9. Object oriented JS</summary>
<br>

Codewars part of this chapter of my journey was pretty easy, since I had my
account a couple of years now. Frogger was very fun to implement. Mage my bugs
respawn and move in two opposite directions. As always learned a lot from the
code reviews.

<details><summary>8. Building a Tiny JS World (pre-OOP)</summary>
<br>

Underwent couple of rounds of code review with this task and learned a lot in
the process. For example, optional chaining operator was totally new concept for
me. So, I hope now I have one more tool on my belt.

<details><summary>7. DOM</summary>
<br>

This one took me much longer than I expected. Struggled a bit with design and
underwent a couple of iterations of code review. And learned quite a bit in the
process. All the points that my mentor have suggested where definitely valid and
improved my code a lot. Also got couple of suggestions about code style and will
be using them in the future for sure.

<details><summary>6. JS Basics</summary>
<br>

This chapter took me a couple days to complete because of weekend and whatnot.
Intro to JS from John Hopkins University is a bit outdated, but I brushed up my
knowledge of basics regardless. And in the process of doing tasks on
FreeCodeCamp I have solidified my understanding of functional programming and
familiarized myself with couple of useful array and string methods I have never
used before.

<details><summary>5. HTML-CSS-Popup</summary>
<br>

So, it was my first practical task, and, as expected, I struggled a lot. I`ve
done couple of ugly projects before, so my goal was to make it look at least
somewhat decent. My first code review definitely was very insightful for me - my
mentor's suggestions opened my eyes on some aspects I never considered before.

<details><summary>4. Responsive Web Design</summary>
<br>

Everything was new for me here, and sheer amount of ways you can do stuff with
grid is definitely surprising, if not to say terrifying, lol ) But I had a lot
of fun with froggies and garden though.

<details><summary>3. Intro to HTML and CSS</summary>
<br>

A lot of new things in this one, to be honest. Though I've had some previous
familiarity with CSS, basically all of the Typography stuff was new and
sometimes surprising for me. But I can definitely see how usefull this knowledge
can be in the future.

<details><summary>2. Git Collaboration</summary>
<br>

Basically all the collaboration stuff was new for me. I can't say anything was
particularly surprising, but all those fancy workflows definitely will be useful
during my future day-to-day working process.

<details><summary>1. Linux CLI, and HTTP</summary>
<br>

Despite being Linux user for quite some time, I've always used GUI to manipulate
stuff. Surprisingly, it looks like console can make some of my routines even
quicker. I will definitely try to use console more. As for HTTP part of the
course - everything was new for me. And yep, I'm definitely going to use HTTP in
the future! :wink:

<details><summary>0. Git basics</summary>
<br>

Though I have worked with Git before, I've used only basic push and pool
commands. So, basically, everything was new for me in this course. The thing
that impressed me the most is the sheer amount of possibilities that GIT
provides. I will definitely use rebasing, merging and cherry-picking in the
future.
